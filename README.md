Showcase
  -Turret
    -Overview:
      -It can be used for Ground or Air based on how the turret was setup. Its unique spray-and-pray mechanic unleashes a wide spread of bullets, saturating the target area rather than locking on to individual enemies.
    -Key Features:
      -360Â° Body Rotation: Smooth full-circle rotation lets the turret scan and engage threats from any direction. You can customize the rotation angle to limit its field of fire as needed.
      -Adjustable Gun Firing Arc: Both the turret base and gun barrel have tunable rotation limits, allowing you to control the size of the firing cone and adapt to different combat scenarios.
      -Spray-and-Pray Firing Mechanic: Bullets spread randomly within the firing arc rather than tracking targets precisely, creating a scattershot effect ideal for suppressing groups of enemies.
